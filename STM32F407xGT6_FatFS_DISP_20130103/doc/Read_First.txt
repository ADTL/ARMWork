========== What is this ? ==========
This is THE ChaN's FatFs Migration Examples for STM32F407x uC!
with MIPI Alliance DBI Type-B&C TFT/OLED/CSTN Display Drivers!


========== To Build and Debug ==========
Supported Only ARM-GCC(EABI)!
To Build And Debug This Programs....

========== Supported TFT-LCD Modules ==========
Nemui-San Supported ONLY Listed Below Interface.
1. MIPI Alliance DBI Type B (i8080 Style 16/8bit Interface)
2. MIPI Alliance DBI Type C (8/9BitSPI(MODE3) Interface)
See ./lib/display/Supported_DisplayControllers.txt and
    ./doc/Supported_DisplayModules.txt
	for more informations!
========== On USING STM32F4Discovery Board CAUTION!! ==========
i8080style 8/16bit-bus Displays Doesn't Support on STM32F4Discovery Hardware!!
Only Serial TFT/OLED Displays Support!!
See Also Board.txt for Necessary Information!


========== Control ChaN's Filer ==========
How to control Filer from UART
   -> UART Inputs from PC's keyboard.
    UP    -> UART:Ctrl+e (0x05),
    DOWN  -> UART:Ctrl+x (0x18),
    LEFT  -> UART:Ctrl+d (0x13),
    RIGHT -> UART:Ctrl+s (0x04),
    OK    -> UART:Enter  (0x0D),
    CAN   -> UART:Esc	 (0x1A),
U can also control via touchpanel if TFT-Module have this.


========== Modification FilerFonts ==========
To enable FONTX2 as FilerFont,
   You should modify two sourcecodes following under lines.
    * in ./inc/ff_support.h  
	30:#define USE_FILER_FONTX	1
 
    * in makefile
	# Use Display Fonts? (misaki(8x8) or M+(10x10) fonts and more)
	#USE_FONTSIZE    = FONT8x8
	USE_FONTSIZE    = FONT10x10
	USE_KANJI		= USE_KANJIFONT <-uncomment this


========== SpeedUP SDIO Clock! ==========
You can Exchange SDIO Clock into Direct(48MHz!)
./lib/ff/sdio_stm32f4.h 
at line:295 
/* Uncomment the following line to Get MAXIMUM Speeeeeed! nemuisan said so! */  
#define SDIO_DIRECT_CLOCK							/* Enable SDIO Bypass CLOCK(48MHzClock!) */



========== FAQ ==========
1.How many amount of SDCARD's Capacity?
->Up to 32GB Card.
  But Recently UHS-1Type CARD doesn't have endurance for hi-rate Clock in SDR MODE.
  In this case, You Should Reduce SDIO or SPI Clock into 12~8MHz.
 
2.Cannot Recognize My CARD.....
->Reduce SDIO or SPI Clock(Default Clock is SDIO:24MHz, SPI:42MHz).

3.Cannot Drive My TFT-LCD....
->Reduce FSMC Access Timings , GPIO Timings ,SPI Clock or HCLK Clocks.
