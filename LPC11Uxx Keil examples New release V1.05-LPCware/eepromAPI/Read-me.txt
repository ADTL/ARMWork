Purpose:
To implement EEPROM API calls on LPC11U2x 

Running mode:
* Compile, Flash the program and reset.
* Setup UART for 9600, 8 data bits, no parity, 1 stop bit

Output:

LPC11Uxx eepromAPI test
'd' - Display Contents of EEPROM (Little Endian)
'f' - Fill EEPROM with 0xFF
'0' - Fill EEPROM with 0x00
'c' - Fill EEPROM with incrementing bytes
't' - Fill EEPROM with timestamps
