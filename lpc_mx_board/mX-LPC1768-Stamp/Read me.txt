1) The mX-LPC1768 Stamp comes with the pre-loaded  Firmware,which tests all the peripherals.You can 
   also test peripherals on board with mX-Base Board rev1.2 individually by the hex files given and observe
   the output as given below.

    HEX files--------------------------------Output to be observed

i)  ADC_UART.hex                             Adjust POT(R14) and watch output at Hyper Terminal through UART0(J4) or UART1(J5) 
					     at the baudrate 38400.

ii) Ext_Int.hex                              Press SW6 and you will hear beep as a interrupt.

iii) Lcd.hex                                 LCD displays "mX-LPC1768 Stamp 
							 NGX TECHNOLOGIES".

iv) Audio.hex                                You will hear sound output through audio jack (U4)

v) USB_HID.hex                               When USB connected, it enumerates as HID,can be observed through the device manager.


vi)I2C_EEPROM.hex                            LED D4 blinks few times and stops at ON position.


vii)PS2_UART.hex                            When connected keyboard, after pressing key the particular 
					    character,number,etc is displayed on UART0(J4) or UART1(J5) 
					     at the baudrate 38400.


viii)UART.hex                               When half Serial Cable connected, it displays the same key through 
				            hyperterminal at 34800 baudrate when any key is pressed on your keyboard.
					    Will test both UART0 and UART1 on board.

ix)  USB_HOST_mXLPC1768.hex                 Create a text naming MSREAD.txt and write anything and save it to the USB stick.Plug 
					    the USb stick onto stamp and press reset.Another file named MSWRITE.txt will be copied 
				            to USB stick with the files of MSREAD.txt.

x) mX-LPC1768_Stamp.hex                     This hex file is the integration of all above experiments.This tests all on board peripeherals
					    except for Ethernet,USB HOST,and SD Card.


xi) mX_SD_card_LPC1768.bin		     This binary tests SD Card, when SD card is FAT formatted and inserted to the board and pressed 
					     reset , a  text saying hello is written to the SD card.Observe output  by reading the SD card.

xii) Ethernet.hex			     This tests the ethernet on board.When connected to LAN ,and configured to the local router 
					     IP address,opens UIP webserver page for configured host IP address. 

xiii) mX-LPC1768S_SDcard.hex                     This tests the SD Card FAT formatted and inserted to the board displays SD CARD PASS on LCD.
