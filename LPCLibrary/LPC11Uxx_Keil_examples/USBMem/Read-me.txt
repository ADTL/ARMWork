Purpose:
Implement USB Mass storage class (MSC) on LPC11Uxx

Running mode:
* Compile, Flash the program and reset.

Note:
For WIN7 environment, the minimum FAT12 file system is 8K. On LPC11Uxx,
the current IRAM is only 4K, so, the maximum RAM allocated for RAM disk drive is 3K. 
Once the RAM disk drive pops out with MSC_MemorySize capacity, it doesn't mean
that you can access the maximum RAM capacity, but the MSC_PhysicalMemorySize minus
the minimum memory allocated for FAT12 Boot sector(approx. 2.5K), etc.
