Purpose:
This example implements Power Management Unit (PMU) on LPC11Uxx

Running mode:
* Compile, Flash the program and reset.

Description:

The LPC11Uxx support a variety of power control features. In Active mode, when the chip
is running, power and clocks to selected peripherals can be optimized for power
consumption. In addition, there are four special modes of processor power reduction with
different peripherals running: Sleep mode, Deep-sleep mode, Power-down mode, and
Deep power-down mode. Section 3.9 of the User manual explains the various modes in detail.

This example allows the user to put the part into various modes by editing the pmu.h header file.
