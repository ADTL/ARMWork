@Example description:
	Purpose:
		This example describes how to use SCT to toggle LED D2 and LED D3
		when there is a match timer occur.
	
					
@Directory contents:
	\Keil: includes Keil project and configuration files 
	lpc18xx_libcfg.h: Library configuration file - include needed driver library for this example 
	Sct_SimpleMatch.c: Main program

@How to run:
	Hardware configuration:		
		This example was tested on:
			LPC1830 Xplorer Board
			
	Running mode:
		Internal SRAM mode:	This example can run on Internal SRAM mode.
					All files must be build to .elf file, this file will be loaded into Internal SRAM through a
					debugger tool before running
					
                SPIFI 32MB Debug mode:
			+ This example can be run on external SPIFI flash:
					- Burn by Keil's Load feature:
						a) Copy all things in ..\..\..\Tools\Flash\Keil_Binaries to
						   C:\Keil\ARM\Flash (Keil uVision 4)
						b) Open Keil->Configure for flash compiling->Compile->Select debugger->Press LOAD 
         

	Step to run:
		- Step 1: Build example.
		- Step 2: Burn hex file into board 
		- Step 3: Run example and observe LED D2 and LED D3 will blinks using SCT.
		
@Tip:
	- Open *.uvproj project file to run example on Keil
