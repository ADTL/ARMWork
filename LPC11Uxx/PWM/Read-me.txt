Purpose:
This example implements Pulse Width Modulation Test modules on LPC11Uxx

Running mode:
* Compile, Flash the program and reset.

Output:
P1_20 toggles continuosly.
Also CT32_1 MAT0 (PIO0_13) and CT16_0 MAT1 (PIO0_9) output waveforms with frequency 48KHz but with duty cycles 75% and 50% respectively.

Note:
PWM frequency used = 48KHz
