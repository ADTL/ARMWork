Purpose:
This example implements Smart Card Interface (SCI) on LPC11Uxx

Running mode:
* Compile, Flash the program and reset.
* Setup UART for 115.2K, 8 data bits, no parity, 1 stop bit

Description:
This example is a basic implementation of the SCI.
The USART on LPC11Uxx is used to indicate card activity.
A detailed implementation of the example can be found in AN11121
